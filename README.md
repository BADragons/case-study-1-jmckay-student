# WD-CaseStudy

I will be trying to make it a commercial website.
  I will be using this website for my art business that Iâ€™m trying to create. Hopefully it will allow people to commission (request) art in different sizes of paper (letter (8.5x11), sketchbook, poster (24x36), and anywhere in between). I want to try and get people art they want at a fairly reasonable price.
  
My goals for this website are:
  Advertise myself and my art to hopefuly get people knowing about me.
  Get people half-decent art that they want cheaply.
  Get better at creating art, so that I can deliver better art.
  Maybe even create a place where people can learn art from me, via video call, or maybe just YouTube or some other platform like that.
Some elements I could add could be something like this:

  A place for customer satisfaction/dissatisfaction reports (I don't know for sure about the dissatisfaction reports, but if I do that, it would help me to know what I could do better, like a rating thing)
  Place samples of my art on there, or a little ad about what I do.
  Give helpful tips about where to go, what to do, or even on how the viewer can draw better.
  Have a little checkout counter thing, where people review what's in their "basket" (I might even call it a portfolio, or something along the lines of that)
  Have a profile or autobiography thing explaining who I am and what I'm trying to accomplish.
  
We will be using the VisualStudio software.

I'm probably going to use something like noblesarts.com, noblesarthub.com, or something else like that.
