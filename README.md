# WD-CaseStudy
Case Study 1

  A) I will be trying to make it a commercial website.
    I will be using this website for my art business that I’m trying to create. Hopefully it will allow people to commission (request) art in different sizes of paper (letter (8.5x11), sketchbook, poster (24x36), and anywhere in between). I want to try and get people art they want at a fairly reasonable price.
  
  B) My goals for this website are:
    Advertise myself and my art to hopefuly get people knowing about me.
    Get people half-decent art that they want cheaply.
    Get better at creating art, so that I can deliver better art.
    Maybe even create a place where people can learn art from me, via video call, or maybe just YouTube or some other platform like that.

  C) Some elements I could add could be something like this:
    A place for customer satisfaction/dissatisfaction reports (I don't know for sure about the dissatisfaction reports, but if I do that, it would help me to know what I could do better, like a rating thing)
    Place samples of my art on there, or a little ad about what I do.
    Give helpful tips about where to go, what to do, or even on how the viewer can draw better.
    Have a little checkout counter thing, where people review what's in their "basket" (I might even call it a portfolio, or something along the lines of that)
    Have a profile or autobiography thing explaining who I am and what I'm trying to accomplish.
  
  D) We will be using the VisualStudio software.

  E) I'm probably going to use something like noblesarts.com, noblesarthub.com, or something else like that.

Case Study 2

  A) Add a last updated section (maybe at the bottom, or maybe at the top so people see it), add a date (at the top).

  B) I could use social media, like Facebook, Discord, Gmail, or Instagram to promote my page.

  C) I could add a chat section, or maybe a place where new artists could put up their art and ask for advice.

  D) Maybe "The Art is Where It's At". I could use that to display that no matter what the artist thinks, if someone thinks it's alright, it's alright.

  E) I could use color to describe an atmosphere (calm, or just buy it all), and maybe in an art demo, use red lines to signal what not to do, and gray to signal what to do.

  F) Dense:
  Art would be fun to turn into a website, I think. I'd be able to translate my work into enjoyment for others. I would also love to host art lessons to get people drawing, or just get them better at art. And, as a bonus, it might give me a chance to earn a little bit of money.
  I plan on making my website an environment of creativity, and hopefully inspiration. I want to be able to give people a reason and means to get better at art. I also want to be able to provide an opportunity to get people half decent art that they want at a reasonable price. 
  I want to make this website a place where people can go to get advice about how to draw/sketch/paint/etc. I also want this to be an inspiratory site where people can go to get ideas on what to draw. I hope that I can make a positive impression on people and I'm going to work to make things easier for them. I hope people will give me feedback on what I can do better or do different.
Chunked:
- Make enjoyment for others, and maybe host art lessons.
- Environment of creativity/inspiration. Give people a means to get better at art. 
- Provide art at a decent price. Help people get advice/inspiration.
- Make a positive impression on people. Get their feedback on what to better/different.
            (All of that was for number F)
            
  G) I'll make it fit on either wide or tall screens (mobile or computer), and to swith between the two by trying to place things in easily accessible places on mobile or PC. I'm going to shove the same amount of work into each part of my website, focusing equaly on details, major titles/pictures, and the central "hub" of the website. I'll try my darndest to make all the content fit in its place or in its folder, whether it be on PC/Desktop or mobile devices like tablets, smartphones, ipads, etc.
  
  H) I could make it easy to use, efficient, and, above all, simple. If it was simple, it would be easier to understand, and thus be easier to use.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Case Study 3

  A) My website's goal is to get people something that they like (be it art, lessons, or maybe a cardboard project) at a reasonable price.
  
  B) My website's target audience is anyone, really. I want to cater to all audiences, and not just focus on one or the other. To me that's like showing favorites. If people do end up actually coming to my website, they will probably want to commision some form of art, or just browse. They might need art lessons, and come to my site for that, or just need a bit of advice, or a pick-me-up, be it comment, post, or satisfactory commision. They will be expecting quality art (if they actually commision some), or lessons that make sense (if they do that). I hope to satisfy that by being interesting, moderately ok at creating art, and just be friendly.
  
  C) A home page, obviously, some pages under that, whiuch would be:
       About Us, Contact Us, Other Media, Products, Help, Customer Testimonials, and whatever else occurs to me in the future.
And again, we would have subpages, branching from those "main" pages.
       About Us
            Mission Statement
            Terms of Use/Service
            Sponsors (BIG maybe on that one)
       Contact Us
            Email
            Discord
            Facebook
            Instagram
            Commissions
       Other Media
            Discord
            YouTube
            Facebook
            Instagram
            Twitch
       Products
            Commisions
                  Subpages for this would be in hierarchical order, going like this:
                  Size to
                  Color (or Black and White) to
                  Artstyle (Realistic, Cartoonish, Anime, etc.) to
                  Description (tell me what to draw) to
                  Checkout
            Lessons
                  Subpages for this might be in web order
                  Books
                  Time (pay monthly, yearly, or just for a week or so
                  All of which lead to Checkout
            Albums (groups of pictures, for a team of characters or something)
                  Checkout
            Pre-drawn stuff
                  For instance:
                  Posters
                  Swag (Stickers)
                  All of which lead to Checkout
       Help
       Customer Testimonials
            Satisfaction reports
            Rating
                (All of that was for number C)
                
  D) This I did on a separate sheet of paper. A piece of paper which I won't lose and will keep updating as the class goes on.
  
  E) I think that a mix of hierarchical and webbed is what I'm going to use. I'm going to have a home page, pages branching off from that, and pages branching off of the subpages. I'm also probably going to make all of the subpages and sub-subpages and sub-sub-subpages (etc, etc) all connect to the home page, for a quick jump back. I might also add a list of where you've been on the side to help with navigation.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Case Study 4

  A) I did this separately. I took like 19 pages of notes on the chapters and have gone through it multiple times.
  
  B) Again, lots of notes. Having a user-based and user-controlled navigation system on my wbsite would probably entail having a search bar up in the top right-ish area of all the pages (obviously). I might have a little drop down thing of categories to help with searching, and I was think of putting a recently searched thing there too. And a pre-filler thing would be cool too.
  
  C) I did this on a piece of papre. I drew out a spider map of the home page, pages branching off of that page, and pages branching out from some of those etc. etc. (if I just kept writing this over and over it'd get boring. I do have a "chart" thing if you scroll up a bit).
  
  D) I've been messing around with this site called color hunter, and this other color wheel site, and I have I few that I like. I'm probably going to go with either a dark red/gray one, a black, white, and grey theme, or I was thinking having a grey and white one lined with dark red or a kind of faded cerulean. 
  
  E) I have the plan if you scroll up a bit. I'm actually not sure how I would control the layout with CSS. I'll probably make a color scheme and template or something with it to style the rest of my pages, but I'm not sure, because I've never done this before.
  
  F) I don't know how to do this part, as I don't know what costs and schedules I can even do yet.
  
  G) This I will do separately, via a piece of paper (probably).
  
  H) This I don't know if we'll do. And if we do, it'll probably be later, as we haven't even gotten to the coding part of this class.
