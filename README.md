# WD-CaseStudy

I will be trying to make it a commercial website.
  I will be using this website for my art business that I’m trying to create. Hopefully it will allow people to commission or request art in different sizes of paper (normal, sketchbook, poster, and anywhere in between). I want to try and get people art they want at a fairly reasonable price.
My goals for this website are:
  Advertise myself and my art to hopefuly get people knowing about me.
  Get people half-decent art that they want cheaply.
  Get better at creating art, so that I can deliver better art.
  Maybe even create a place where people can learn art from me, via video call, or maybe just YouTube or some other platform like that.
Some elements I could add could be something like this:
  A place for customer satisfaction/dissatisfaction reports (I don't know for sure about the dissatisfaction reports, but if I do that, it would help me to know what I could do better, like a rating thing)
  Place samples of my art on there, or a little ad about what I do.
  Give helpful tips about where to go, what to do, or even on how the viewer can draw better.
  Have a little checkout counter thing, where people review what's in their "basket" (I might even call it a portfolio, or something along the lines of that)
  Have a profile or autobiography thing explaining who I am and what I'm trying to accomplish.
We will be using Git and GitHub, most likely.
I was thinking something like noblesarts.com, or something else like that.
