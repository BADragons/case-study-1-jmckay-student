# WD-CaseStudy

Commercial
  I will be using this website for my art business that I’m trying to create. Hopefully it will allow people to commission or request art in different sizes of paper (normal, sketchbook, poster, and anywhere in between)
Goals are:
  Help people find my art
  Get people half-decent art that they want cheaply
  Get better at art myself
  Maybe art lessons?
Elements
  Customer satisfaction/dissatisfaction (strong what if, but if so, say we’re working on it) reports
  Art samples
  Helpful tips
  “Checkout counter"
Git and GitHub, most likely
