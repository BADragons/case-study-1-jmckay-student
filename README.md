# WD-CaseStudy
Case Study 1

  I will be trying to make it a commercial website.
    I will be using this website for my art business that I’m trying to create. Hopefully it will allow people to commission (request) art in different sizes of paper (letter (8.5x11), sketchbook, poster (24x36), and anywhere in between). I want to try and get people art they want at a fairly reasonable price.
  
  My goals for this website are:
    Advertise myself and my art to hopefuly get people knowing about me.
    Get people half-decent art that they want cheaply.
    Get better at creating art, so that I can deliver better art.
    Maybe even create a place where people can learn art from me, via video call, or maybe just YouTube or some other platform like that.

  Some elements I could add could be something like this:
    A place for customer satisfaction/dissatisfaction reports (I don't know for sure about the dissatisfaction reports, but if I do that, it would help me to know what I could do better, like a rating thing)
  
    Place samples of my art on there, or a little ad about what I do.
    Give helpful tips about where to go, what to do, or even on how the viewer can draw better.
    Have a little checkout counter thing, where people review what's in their "basket" (I might even call it a portfolio, or something along the lines of that)
    Have a profile or autobiography thing explaining who I am and what I'm trying to accomplish.
  
  We will be using the VisualStudio software.

  I'm probably going to use something like noblesarts.com, noblesarthub.com, or something else like that.

Case Study 2

  Add a last updated section (maybe at the bottom, or maybe at the top so people see it), add a date (at the top).

  I could use social media, like Facebook, Discord, Gmail, or Instagram to promote my page.

  I could add a chat section, or maybe a place where new artists could put up their art and ask for advice.

  Maybe "The Art is Where It's At". I could use that to display that no matter what the artist thinks, if someone thinks it's alright, it's alright.

  I could use color to describe an atmosphere (calm, or just buy it all), and maybe in an art demo, use red lines to signal what not to do, and gray to signal what to do.

Dense:
  Art would be fun to turn into a website, I think. I'd be able to translate my work into enjoyment for others. I would also love to host art lessons to get people drawing, or just get them better at art. And, as a bonus, it might give me a chance to earn a little bit of money.
  I plan on making my website an environment of creativity, and hopefully inspiration. I want to be able to give people a reason and means to get better at art. I also want to be able to provide an opportunity to get people half decent art that they want at a reasonable price. 
  I want to make this website a place where people can go to get advice about how to draw/sketch/paint/etc. I also want this to be an inspiratory site where people can go to get ideas on what to draw. I hope that I can make a positive impression on people and I'm going to work to make things easier for them. I hope people will give me feedback on what I can do better or do different.
Chunked:
- Make enjoyment for others, and maybe host art lessons.
- Environment of creativity/inspiration. Give people a means to get better at art. 
- Provide art at a decent price. Help people get advice/inspiration.
- Make a positive impression on people. Get their feedback on what to better/different.

  I'll make it fit on either wide or tall screens (mobile or computer), and to swith between the two by trying to place things in easily accessible places on mobile or PC. I'm going to shove the same amount of work into each part of my website, focusing equaly on details, major titles/pictures, and the central "hub" of the website. I'll try my darndest to make all the content fit in its place or in its folder, whether it be on PC/Desktop or mobile devices like tablets, smartphones, ipads, etc.
  
  I could make it easy to use, efficient, and, above all, simple. If it was simple, it would be easier to understand, and thus be easier to use.
